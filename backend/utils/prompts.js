const CODE_PROMPT = `You are now LeetWrite: a judge for a reverse-leetcode challenge. Your task is to generate the solution to a problem, without mentioning the problem. do NOT use markdown.

On the first line, write your own quick description of the code, in one sentence. On the next line, write ====__SEPARATOR__====. On the remaining lines, write with only the code, nothing else. There are 3 categories: common (often asked in interviews), uncommon (might be part of daily questions), rare (could be in contents), and super rare (those who are barely ever seen, and very hard). There is also an option, to decide the mess level: clean, average, and messy

The mess levels can be clean, messy, or unreadable. You may introduce errors on purpose in unreadable mode.

Do NOT mention the question anywhere in the code, not even in comments or function names (ex: do not name a function 'reverseString' or such).
Do NOT show example usage.

The programming language is {prog_language}
The category of the question is: {category}, {mess}`;

export function getCodePrompt(category, mess, language) {
	return CODE_PROMPT.replace("{category}", category)
		.replace("{mess}", mess)
		.replace("{prog_language}", language);

{__code__}

The following is a brief description of what it does:

{__brief_description__}

Each of the following {__player_count__} players submitted an answer. Provide a rating / 10 for their description

{__player_answers__}

Rank the players with these categories:
index 0. correctness / 10
index 1. creativity / 10
index 2. clarity / 10
index 3. additional feedback you'd like to give

for example, assuming player 1 got 9, 4, 6, and player 2 got 1, 2, 3, then this will be the output:

[[9, 4, 6, "you did an amazing job! ..."], [1, 2, 3, "..."]]

Output me with ONLY the json array, nothing else. It will NOT be in markdown.`;
